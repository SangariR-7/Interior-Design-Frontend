    <center> <h2>Welcome to Our Website!</h2> </center>
    <p> Home decor and interior design involve enhancing the interior of a building to create a more aesthetically pleasing and functional environment. An interior designer plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects, considering conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, communicating with stakeholders, and construction management. Interior decorating is outfitting a space with aesthetically pleasing elements such as furniture, wall-coverings, accessories, rugs and more. </p>
